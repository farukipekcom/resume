        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          My journey in web development began in 2016 when I created my first website. Through WordPress, I gained a solid foundation in web
          technologies, and I've been developing web projects ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
          My primary focus is on building fast, engaging interfaces, currently with a keen interest in Next.js. I enjoy crafting designs and
          writing HTML & CSS to bring ideas to life.
